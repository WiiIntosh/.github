WiiIntosh is a collection of projects to enable creation of a Hackintosh on the Wii and Wii U consoles. These used a variant of the PowerPC 750 (named Broadway and Espresso respectively) which is the same as the PowerPC G3 used in a variety of Macs supported by Mac OS X 10.0 to 10.4.

Running Mac OS X is accomplished with an Open Firmware implementation ([OpenBIOS](https://github.com/WiiIntosh/openbios)) loaded from a CFW running on the [Starlet](https://github.com/WiiIntosh/wii-loader) or [Starbuck](https://github.com/WiiIntosh/wiiu-loader). Patches to XNU/BootX are applied and drivers are injected during the BootX load process.

This is still very much a work in progress and there will be instablity and bugs encountered, and not all hardware or possible Mac OS X versions are supported at this time.
